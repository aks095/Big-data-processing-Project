# BIG DATA PROCESSING PROJECT

•  Implemented Python-based multi-threaded priority queue for top-k similar items using cosine similarity on large datasets

•  Developed custom MapReduce function with Hadoop-like shuffle and sort to identify frequent bi-grams in text files

•  Utilized PySpark to count heavy hitter nodes and triangles in large undirected graphs using scalable analysis techniques
